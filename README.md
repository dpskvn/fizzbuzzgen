## (or what insomnia does to people)

Apparently, it's a job requirement to write one of these or something. Or a requirement to get a job...

## Usage

`npm install`

You'll need node v0.11.x to run this thing. With the `--harmony` flag. So...

`node --harmony app.js`

I just don't know why you'd want to do that. :)
